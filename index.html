        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <a href="/assets.craig.pic.jpg"></a>
        <p>I'm a tall person with the name of Craig. Learning tends to be a hobby of mine, and my wife thinks that would be my X-Men super power if I had mutant abilities.</p>
            <br>
        <p>I like numbers! Most of my job revolves around identifying how a business makes money, and giving advice on methods or techniques that businesses can do in order to maximize profits. I am incredibly proud of my wife. She started her own business 4 years ago, and has learned a lot along the way on how to build a good company. Owning your own business can be stressful at times, but she's made incredible strides to become better at leading her team.</p>
            <br>
        <p>While I enjoy my job, I feel that any occupation or industry has the risk of becoming obsolete. I'd rather not grow old and be the guy that doesn't keep up on his skills. This bootcamp is my step towards developing new skills and becoming more and more employable in this world.</p>
